SERVER

ok - BUG: if you have at least one game created and try to quit there is a server error

ok - REVIEW: the createroom command should respond with a RoomInfo event (it will be easier for client to decide 
        whether to join automatically or not)

- re-enable and test the responses
  (some tests carried out.. more to come - mainly subscribegamelist - including renaming)

- it seems that we'll need another communication "channel" (event route) for host related stuff (desireToJoin only?)

ok - a serverCommand to list the available engines

CLIENT

ok - trap the exit/refresh events and quit the server on those occasions (connection is being left open)

--------------

ENHANCEMENT: backdoor? (for management purposes?)

ENHANCEMENT: user authentication (for record keeping)

--------------

ok - enterRoom {gameid}
  should allow you to enter the game "room"
  
ok - quitRoom {gameid}
  you exit the game "room" AND if playing, you also leave the seat open
  game changes to replacement_needed
  
ok - seatGame {gameid}
  works only if you are already inside that game "room"
  take next available seat if game is not started
  NO: (just too complex) start game automatically if 4th seat is taken
  
ok - leaveGame {gameid}
  abandon the game but stay in the room

- desireToJoinGame {gameid}{seatid}
  player in the "room" informs desire to play in an available seat
  only available if game is in REPLACEMENT_NEEDED

--------------

ok - startGame {gameid}
  run only by the host
  starts the game

- promote {gameid}{playerHash}
  run only by the host
  playerHash becomes the host
  
- kick {gameid}{playerHash}
  run only by the host
  forces a quitGame on that playerHash
  
- allocateReplacement {gameid}{playerHash}{seatid}
  run only by the host
  allocates the playerHash (already in the "room") to that seat
